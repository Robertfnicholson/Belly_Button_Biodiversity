# Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge â€“ 
## Overview of Project

This challenge principally involved developing data visualizations using JavaScript. I used Plotly, a JavaScript data 
visualization library. As part of the project I manipulated, parsed and transformed data. I developed dashboards to 
visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer. Specifically, the volunteers should be able to identify the top 10 
bacterial species in their belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to 
manufacture synthetic beef, the volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel. My 
code can be found in charts.js, index.html, and style.css. /</p>
